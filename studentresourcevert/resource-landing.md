# Fixing Issues

## Are you stuck on something? 

Here is the sequence of steps you might follow, although the exact things you do obviously will depend on the task:
1. blah
1. blah
1. blah

procedure: readme/help functions, py documentation, stack overflow, peers, our github, google, then me

# Resources

### The standbys
- Google, Stack Overflow, [Github help](https://help.github.com), [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html), [Python help](https://www.python.org/doc/): can't be beat
- [Coding best practices, and project management](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml)

### Python
- [A whirlwind tour of python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)
- [datacamp.com](datacamp.com) has many self guided lessons
- [Python cheat sheet](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.cheatsheet/blob/master/python/python-cheatsheet.pdf), note there are many, many more online

### Data Science (broad)
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
- [Probably the best collection of Python noteooks on the web](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks)

### Data visualization
- **[Kaggle's Data viz tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/welcome-to-data-visualization) is excellent**. It has reproducible code and data, using python. 
- [An Economist's Guide to Visualizing Data](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.28.1.209) is excellent as well.
- [STAT545 on good visualization](https://stat545.com/effective-graphs.html)
- [Data Visualization: A practical introduction, by Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata) especially discusses the "whys" of visualization in a smart way. The walkthroughs are in R, not python, however. 
- [Some good data viz blogs](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/best-data-visualization-blogs)

### Github, Git, and Version control
- [Getting started on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and a twitter length [description of how a project flows](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary) 
- [Jenny Bryan on version control](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2575/6e04f126da30e26b447801a5e2d3e51e3154.pdf)
- Again... [Coding best practices, and project management](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml)
- [The most thorough yet simple walkthrough of Git and Github use on the web](https://happygitwithr.com). Applies to python use for the most part. 
  
### Data, and practice ML
- [Scikit (python package) can read in some data](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html), which has data on Boston real estate, wine, a larger california housing dataset 
- [Pandas can read in a LOT of useful data!](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readers/index.html) **Data providers include: Federal Reserve, Ken French, NASDAQ, OECD, Qunadl, TSP, World Bank, and more!**
- [ML competitions with serious prizes at drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/)
  - [This comp was interesting](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/50/worldbank-poverty-prediction/page/99/). You could start trying [to analyze it here](http://drivendata.co/blog/worldbank-poverty-benchmark/). This has a good example of the process you might follow. After you're done, you can see [the winner's code and discussion of the winning approach](https://github.com/drivendataorg/pover-t-tests/tree/9a1918856c5e6ee537caed103eb80dabefb2fe44)  
- **[kaggle.com](kaggle.com) has ML competitions, some FAQs, tutorials, data and competitions*
  - [Real estate data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), a tutorial [exploring that data](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python), and a [pass at a model](https://www.kaggle.com/juliencs/a-study-on-regression-applied-to-the-ames-dataset)
  - Philly based data would be fun. Here is [real estate, one option for data, seems ok, N=805](https://www.kaggle.com/harry007/philly-real-estate-data-set-sample)
  - [Predict box office for movies](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction). VaultML claims they can do this by reading the screenplays and using textual analysis tools
  - [Wine, but not necessarily the best data source](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
- [UC Irvine has a data repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), some of these are available via scikit package
  - [Predicting where the wine is from (wine/location](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) <--- easy starter challenge (where is the wine from?)
  - [Wine Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
  - [German credit data by person](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))

### Some books you might look for
- [Signal and the Noise, by Nate Silver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420411X)
- [Range, by David Epstein](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) is a very interesting book generally, and it touches on prediction skill too
- [Superforecasters](https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718)
  - A decent [free summary](https://medium.com/west-stringfellow/superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction-review-and-summary-e075be35a936)
