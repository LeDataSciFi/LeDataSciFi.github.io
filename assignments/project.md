### Initial proposals

- General idea: The question are you interested in, the data you need to acquire, the variables you'll use, and the  plan for how you'll analyze it (what methods you'll try and why you think they apply to your problem), considerations about how data might impact that.
- Instructions are [here](project_initial.html).
- Graded on: question viability, creativity, finance application, and plan sketch

<!-- 
- How to: Write proposal within README file, and start it with "#Research Proposal: \< Title \>"
- Answer [the questions in 1, 2, and 3 here](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/01/lifecycle_students_1.html) within your proposal
-->

### Peer review/critiques/suggestions
