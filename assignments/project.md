# The semester project

There is no one way to do all of this, but if you feel as though you can go further, you probably can, and you should. 

The project will have several deliverable stages to keep us on track, according to the [schedule](https://ledatascifi.github.io/#schedule). _Changes to that master schedule supercede any dates below._

1. 8% **Project proposal (initial)**. Discussed [below](#initial-proposals) with specific instructions [here](https://ledatascifi.github.io/assignments/project_initial.html).
2. 10% **Peer review/critiques/suggestions**.  Discussed [below](#peer-reviewcritiquessuggestions) with specific instructions [here](project_peer_review.html).
2. 10% **Project proposal (final)**. Discussed [below](#final-proposals).
3. 15% **Project status report**. Discussed [below](#project-status-report).
4. 45% **Written component - report and presentation files**. Discussed [below](#written-components).
5. 12% **Presentations**. Discussed [below](#presentations).

### A note on ambition

Ambition will be considered when grading the written component and results. 

The goal of the project is not to simply take a pre-cleaned dataset, and run a basic analysis. You want to take unfiltered data, from one or many sources, and combine them into a usable, clean dataset. Consider the depth of your analysis as you gather and clean this data. Are you just gathering data about the height and weight of a sample and looking at the correlation of these two variables? That level is not sufficient for the end goal of this project. You would be better off using this data to predict the gender of an individual, given height and weight entered by a user, and using the data to make these predictions. Always ask yourself if you can take your analysis one step further. If you answered yes, go for it! Use your data to extract information, gather this information, and draw conclusions. 

### Initial proposals

**Instructions are [here](project_initial.html).**

- General idea: The question are you interested in, the data you need to acquire, the variables you'll use, and the  plan for how you'll analyze it (what methods you'll try and why you think they apply to your problem), considerations about how data might impact that.
- Graded on: question viability, creativity, finance application, and plan sketch

<!-- 
- How to: Write proposal within README file, and start it with "#Research Proposal: \< Title \>"
- Answer [the questions in 1, 2, and 3 here](https://www.textbook.ds100.org/ch/01/lifecycle_students_1.html) within your proposal
-->

### Peer review/critiques/suggestions

**Instructions are [here](project_peer_review.html).**

- General idea: Each TEAM will look at one other proposal and suggest significant avenues for improvement. This is important!
- Graded on: The quality and substance of your team's review. I am only asking for each team to do one review, but I expect a high level of contribution, both on thought process and data. This likely will require your team to explore yourselves the data sources potentially useful for the team you're reviewing. 

### Final proposals

- General idea: Take feedback and heavily modify your plan as warranted. (Up to and including scrapping the question!) 
- More details later

### Project status report

- General idea: You've now acquired the key data and finished most of the data cleaning. 
- Report has nice data sections describing data source(s) and how you got/cleaned the data
- Needs to show progress and that you're on track!
