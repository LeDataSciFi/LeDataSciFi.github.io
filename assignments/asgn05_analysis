This file should:
1. Load `output/ccm_with_risk.dta`
1. Explain and describe to readers your risk measurements 
    - How where they measured?
    - What do you hope they capture?
    - What are their statistical properties? (Mandatory checks: Does count=148 for all, and none are all 0s?)
    - Discuss briefly whether these measurements are likely "valid" in the sense they capture what you hope.  
    - BONUS: If possible / merited, present some evidence they do capture your hopes. (You probably don't have enough data here to validate that your measure is associated with the actual risk. But if you do, show us!) **This step (validating the measurement) is very important in production quality analysis!***
1. Explore the correlation between **2008** investment (CAPX and R&D) and **2007** technology.
    - Present your findings visually and follow the lessons on effective visualization!
    - **AGAIN: NOTICE THE YEAR SHIFT!**
    - _Note: Because investment is the "outcome", we want the "inputs" to be measured before the 2008 fiscal year starts, which is why we use the prior year ("lagged") technology variables_
    - You should write brief summaries of your findings.
1. Explore the correlation between **2008** investment (CAPX and R&D) and **2007** risk variables you created
    - Present your findings visually and follow the lessons on effective visualization!
    - **AGAIN: NOTICE THE YEAR SHIFT!**
    - You should write brief summaries of your findings.
1. Bonus: Explore the relationships between investment, tech, and risks simultaneously using regressions. 
    - One regression where CAPX is the independent variable and the right side is log(assets), market to book (which is a proxy for Q!), cash, log(patent stock), and a risk
    - One regression where R&D is the independent variable and the right side is log(assets), market to book (which is a proxy for Q!), cash, log(patent stock), and a risk
    - Don't worry about printing these out "pretty", just try them if you want!
