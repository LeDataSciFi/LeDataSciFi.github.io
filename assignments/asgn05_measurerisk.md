# `measure_risk.ipnyb`

This file:
1. Loads the initial dataset.
2. Loops over the rows. For each row, load the corresponding 10-K and measure 5 risks from it, and save those new measurements to each of 5 new variables in that row.
3. Save the augmented dataset (the original data plus 5 new risk variables) to `output/ccm_with_risk.dta`
