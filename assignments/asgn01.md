# Assignment 1 - Our tools

## Overview 

**Due date: See the [schedule](https://ledatascifi.github.io/#schedule).**

Let's practice the tools we cover in the first two weeks: GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Markdown, and Jupyter (Python). We will:

1. Create and simple repo on GitHub and clone it to our computer
2. Work on a python file, adding Markdown features to it
3. Make an informative README.md file so that visitors to your repo understand it.

## Let's get started: Creating and using a repo

1. First, read the [homework guidelines](guidelines-asgn.html).
2. Click on the invitation link I sent to you and accept the assignment on GitHub. This will create a repo containing 
  - README.md
  - Assignment 01.ipynb
3. Clone it to your computer following the steps from [the workflow recipe in Lecture 1](https://ledatascifi.github.io/lectures-spr2020/01/01_Motivation_and_Getting_Started.html#***-THE-WORKFLOW-RECIPE--***).
  - You can decide where you want to put this folder. Anywhere that makes sense to you should be fine.
  - After GitHub Desktop clones the repo, open the folder on your computer.
  - Copy the path to that folder, e.g. `C:\Users\Don\Desktop\ASGN01` and open up the README file in a text editor. Paste the path where I have typed <path> (eliminate the "<" and ">" symbols!), and replace "<Anaconda Powershell or Terminal, depending on your OS>" so that the sentence says "...I open Anaconda Powershell and..." or "...I open Terminal and...". Save your edits to the README.
  
## Working with Jupyter

1. Open Anaconda Powershell or Terminal
2. Open Jupyter using the command that you just left in the README. You can type it or [paste it using these directions](https://ledatascifi.github.io/lectures-spr2020/01/02_Jupyter_Basics.html#Before-next-class).
