# Assignment 1 - Our tools

## Overview 

**Due date: See the [schedule](https://ledatascifi.github.io/#schedule).**

Let's practice the tools we cover in the first two weeks: GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Markdown, and Jupyter (Python). We will:

1. Create a simple repo on GitHub and clone it to our computer
2. Work on a python file, adding Markdown features to it
3. Make an informative README.md file so that visitors to your repo understand it.

## Let's get started: Creating and cloning a repo and our first README edit

1. First, read the [homework guidelines](guidelines-asgn.html).
2. Click on the invitation link I sent to you and accept the assignment on GitHub. This will create a repo containing 
  - README.md
  - Assignment 01 worksheet.ipynb
3. Clone it to your computer following the steps from [the workflow recipe in Lecture 1](https://ledatascifi.github.io/lectures-spr2020/01/01_Motivation_and_Getting_Started.html#***-THE-WORKFLOW-RECIPE--***).
  - You can decide where you want to put this folder. Anywhere that makes sense to you should be fine.
  - After GitHub Desktop clones the repo, open the folder on your computer.
4. Edit the README file.  
  - Copy the path to that folder, e.g. `C:\Users\Don\Desktop\ASGN01` and open up the README file in a text editor of your choosing. (I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). Popular editors include [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/) and many more.) Paste the path where I have typed <path> (eliminate the "<" and ">" symbols!), and replace "<Anaconda Powershell or Terminal, depending on your OS>" so that the sentence says "...I open Anaconda Powershell and..." or "...I open Terminal and...". Save your edits to the README.
  
## Working within Jupyter

### Opening the files

1. Open Anaconda Powershell or Terminal
2. Open Jupyter using the command that you just left in the README. You can type it or [paste it using these directions](https://ledatascifi.github.io/lectures-spr2020/01/02_Jupyter_Basics.html#Before-next-class).
3. Now you should see in your browser the README.md and "Assignment 01.ipynb" files. Jupyter will nicely edit both files _**and render**_ them (make them look pretty).
  - Open both files in new tabs so that you can work on both simultaneously.

### Working with Markdown - the README file. 

- The beginning of the README should contain a very brief description as to what the repository is (a sentence or two), so that an unknowing visitor landing on the repository can orient themselves. You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate).
- Then, introduce yourself briefly with some personal details and professional goals, including some goal related to this class. 
- **Showcase five functionalities of GitHub-flavoured markdown.** The [markdown cheatsheet on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) might help, or click the Help menu in Jupyter and click on Markdown. [This file goes way above and beyond](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw01/sample_readme.md) but the author got a lot of good practice and surely was able to use these features many times through their class. 

### Working on the ipynb file

**Follow all the directions in the Assignment worksheet file. Complete all exercises.**

### Polish the repo for "publication"

**Open the README file again. Update it as needed in light of the new structure of the repo. (Aren't there new files and folders?)**

## Peer review instructions

Everyone will review two peers. 

1. Click on the two invitation links I sent to you and accept the assignment on GitHub. You will have access to two peer's assignment repos.
2. Open an issue on their homework repo, copy the rubric below ([available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeDataSciFi/LeDataSciFi.github.io/master/assignments/asgn01.md)), and fill in your review there.

\* _See "ease of access" in guidelines_

\*\* _See answer key_

\*\*\* _Grade on completeness_

Remarks:

* Elaborate on above, especially for "needs work."
* Some specific praise?
* Something I learned?
* Specific constructive criticism?
* Something I know and that you, my peer, might like to know because it is relevant to something you struggled with.
