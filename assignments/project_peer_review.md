  > ## Summary
  >
  > _This section should contain a paragraph summarizing your big picture takeaways about the proposal._
  >
  > ## Major Comments
  >
  > 1. _This section is an enumerated list of paragraphs, like what you see here. Issues should be ranked in the order of importance. You should probably highlight 3-8 things (maybe more) and I would like you to focus on SOLUTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS you can offer them._
  > 2. Look through the following things. Separate them into major and lessor issues. The lessor issues go in the next section.
  > 3. Major comments should get a little more discussion (but limit each to a paragraph or two). Further comments should be bullet points.
  > 2. _You should read their report, and think about the question/problem_ 
  >     - do you have a "spin" or "angle" to help "sell" the project as interesting (e.g. for a newspaper)
  >     - is it too large to solve here or too easy to solve here, e.g. someone has already posted a solution. if so, the group will need to narrow the question or shift it to avoid previous work
  >     - is it finance related? if not, can it (and how) be made finance related?
  > 3. _Other things to consider and evaluate on the question:_
  >     - what do you think about the hypothesis? should it be changed, or some aspects added, or something removed?
  >     - is the plan 
  >     - are the metrics for success reasonable given the question
  > 3. _Things things to consider and evaluate on the data:_  
  >     - Does the observation level make sense for the question?
  >     - Is the sample period sufficient and/or realistic given the question and availability of data
  >     - Should they add, remove, or change any sample conditions?
  >     - Do you think they need any unmentioned variables? Are any of the "like to have" variables actually necessary?
  >     - Do you think they should try to get any unmentioned variables?
  >     - Other viability issues (the data isn't available)
  >     - Do you have any ideas for data sources, or recommendations about getting data they need?
  > 4. If you have thoughts on the data processing or models they might use, I'm sure your classmates would be interested!

  > ## Further Comments
  >
