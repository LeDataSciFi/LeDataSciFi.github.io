# Peer review guidelines

As part of this course you will be reviewing, commenting on, and marking other students’ assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be marked on your peer reviews.

## Peer review workflow

1. After a homework deadline, you will receive an email inviting you to the repos of **TWO** classmates. Accept these invitations.
2. Navigate to your classmates’ homework submissions and look it over. If there are any specific instructions in the README.md or the assignment prompt about grading a particular assignment, follow those.
3. Open a new Issue on their homework repository and fill in your review:

- Generally, you will copy the [peer review template here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeDataSciFi/LeDataSciFi.github.io/master/assignments/peerreview_template.md) into that Issue, fill in your and the reviewee's GitHub IDs, add an "x" where needed for grades, and fill out the remarks. 
- How should you decide between "Excellent", "Satisfactory", and "Needs Work"? [Jump to the guide to filling out a rubric below](#assigning-grades).
- Some assignments might ask you to evaluate specific things or additional topics. Follow those instructions if present.

## How are peer reviews themselves graded?

<table >
  <tr>
    <td> (0) </td>    
    <td> Poor (F) </td>
    <td> Unsatisfactory (D) 	 </td>
    <td> Satisfactory (C- to C+)  </td>
    <td> Good (B- to B+) </td>
    <td> Excellent (A- to A+)  </td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> No attempt </td>    
    <td> The review is mean or disrespectful. </td>
    <td> The review is so generic that it's hard to determine which assignment it's reviewing. It doesn't offer any praise and yet doesn't offer any suggestions either. </td>
    <td>  </td>
    <td>  </td>
    <td> The review contains thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments. It is specific and concise. </td>

# Peer review tips

## **Q:** I wasn't invited to review a repo!

This probably means that we don’t have you on the class roster. Email me immediately, or tag me in an issue on the class's discussion repo.

## How to give a good peer review

- Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.
- Be specific and concise.
- Use the assignment rubric for ideas about criteria to evaluate and comment on 
- Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out!
- If you can’t find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.
- To ensure reproducibility, you might find it useful to clone your classmate’s repo and attempt to run their script(s). If you cannot execute them, then the code is not reproducible. Also be aware your classmates will hold you to a similar standard.

## How to give a bad peer review 

- Your review is so generic that it’s hard to determine which assignment you’re reviewing
- Your review is mean
- You can’t find anything to praise/learn and yet you don’t offer any suggestions either

# Filling out the rubric

*Also consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself*

| Topic| Excellent  | Satisfactory | Needs work |
|-----------| ---------------------- |--------------------------| ----------------------|
|**Coding style**| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable|
|**Coding strategy**| Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors  | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. |   Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
|**Presentation** | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point. <br><br> Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.| Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. <br><br> Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. <br><br> Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.|
|**Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity**|Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps, somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.|
|**Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work** |Access as easy as possible, code runs! | Satisfactory | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions  and/or code does not run|
