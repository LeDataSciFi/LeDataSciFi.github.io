# Peer review guidelines

As part of this course you will be reviewing, commenting on, and marking other students’ assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be marked on your peer reviews.

## Peer review workflow

1. After a homework deadline, you will receive an email inviting you to the repos of **TWO** classmates. Accept these invitations.
2. Navigate to your classmates’ homework submissions, look it over, and open a new Issue on their homework repository with your review. Generally, you will copy the [peer review template here](peerreview_template.md) into that Issue.
