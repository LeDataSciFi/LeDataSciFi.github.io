_**(I suspect that the initial learning curve will be steep, so I have posted a lot of office hours. Around Valentines Day, I will reduce my explicit office hours. Remember, when you get stuck, to check out the Stuck Resources (link to it **xxxxxxxxxx**)

# Schedule

Put a schedule table here. Would be great if it dynamically highligts/emphasizes next valid date.

Items in table: Date, Lecture (# with link), Topic/description

# Syllabus 

(1) project management and programming golden rules, 

organized workflows and good programming habits reduce errors, increase speed, and make it easier for others to read it (including yourself when you look at the code 8 months later)
portable code is better, too 	 
intro to programming	
oh: working "asynchronously" on group projects is a way of life in 21st century jobs, we're going to learn how to do that with more productively* and with fewer headaches**

(2) Python (our programming language), Anaconda and Spyder - how we will use python

(3) data cleaning and organization 

some data will be given to you and well organized.
but much of the data that will be given to you will be poorly organized.
we are going to learn good dataset habits

(4) some web crawling and data scraping, 

some data will be given to you.
but most of the world's data is uncollected and unorganized (despite google's best efforts)
finding and using that data - that's where we make our money	

(5) prediction models and data analysis

what we're going to do with the data. producing and improving a model. applied econometrics (ie more conceptual than mathematical rigor) to understand and improve the output
understanding the how "data analysis/ML/<<buzz word #51>>" fit into the bigger picture of producing and using knowledge. to quote Prof Gunther: data < info < knowledge < wisdom
learning from the model:  what does the output of my analysis mean? (A and B are related, but **WHY**)
