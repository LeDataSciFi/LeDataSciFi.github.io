 <b> Objectives, briefly </b>
</p>
1. obtain, explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data 
2. make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable 

(1) puts the world of data at your fingertips, (2) makes the essential task of collaboration &mdash; a must in (complicated and large) real-world projects &mdash; easier. We will work in **Python**, and work on applying the lessons to financial problems.

### Student Drop-in Hours 

**I suspect that the initial learning curve will be steep, so I have posted a lot of office hours. Around Valentines Day, I will reduce my explicit office hours. Remember, when you get stuck, to check out the resources in the [Resources and Help tab](https://ledatascifi.github.io/studentresourcevert/resource-landing.html).**

**In RBC 460, with Prof. Bowen:**
- Tu 10am-11am

# Syllabus 

### Objectives, in more detail 

<b> (1) project management and programming golden rules>

- organized workflows and good programming habits reduce errors, increase speed, and make it easier for others to read it (including yourself when you look at the code 8 months later)
- portable code is better, too 	 
- intro to programming	
- oh: working "asynchronously" on group projects is a way of life in 21st century jobs, we're going to learn how to do that more productively* and with fewer headaches**

\* = $$$, and ** = :)

<b> (2) our data science "stack" </b>

- Python: Loaded via Anaconda, and coding in Jupyter (and Spyder when it suits the task)
- Github: Sharing and storing code, data, and reports + collaboration
- Git: Version control system. Can think of it like Google Docs or "track changes" in Microsoft Word, but built for software projects that teams work on.  

<b> (3) data: cleaning, exploring, visualizing and organizing  </b>

- some data will be given to you and well organized
- but much of the data that will be given to you will be poorly organized
- so we need to know how to explore it (both to clean it and learn from it)
- tables will help you understand data, but visuals are usually better
- we are going to learn good dataset habits
 
<b> (4) web crawling and data scraping </b>

- some data will be given to you.
- but most of the world's data is uncollected and unorganized (despite google's best efforts)
- finding and using that data - that's where we make our money	

<b> (5) prediction models and data analysis </b>

- what we're going to do with the data. producing and improving a model. applied econometrics (ie more conceptual than mathematical rigor) to understand and improve the output
- understanding the how "data analysis/ML/<<buzz word #51>>" fit into the bigger picture of producing and using knowledge.* to quote Prof Gunther: data < info < knowledge < wisdom
- learning from the model:  what does the output of my analysis mean? (A and B are related, but **WHY**) 	

\* _"A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers. If you want to be a good data scientist, you should spend ~49% of your time developing your statistical intuition (i.e. how to ask good questions of the data), and ~49% of your time on domain knowledge (improving overall understanding of your field). Only ~2% on methods per se."_ - Nate Silver

<b> Outputs: </b>

1. Use all methods above in one project that can be on your resume +  teaches peers/myself + demonstrates accumulated finance knowledge + (BONUS) shows off ability to deliver reports/work product that bosses 
2. Your resume can now list several new skills employers pay $$$ for
3. Your resume can now list a completed project showing off those skills (which employers pay $$$ for)
4. Experience you can take to interviews

### Practical Matters and Expectations

- **I expect students to attend all classes.** It is crucial to learning the content in this class, but also for hearing announcements and course changes. _Remember: This class is brand new, so things are liable to change. If you don't attend class, you will be offguard or unaware of developments I announce verbally._ 
- **Please bring your laptops to class.** This will be a very hands-on course, with relatively little in the way of formal theory. Instead, we’ll be working through lecture notes together in class and you’ll be running code on your own machines. 
- **Participation is essential for understanding and integrating the material.** All students should be willing to volunteer answers, speculation, and argue for different approaches. Students should engage with hypotheticals in discussions, and be working on the code of the moment when called. Participation grade is based on: (1) submitted codes developed during class, (2) preparation when cold-called, and (3) volunteering answers. Please don't over-volunteer: I will cap credit at some point. 
- **The whole class is run off this website and GitHub. GitHub is how we'll submit assignmnts, provide feedback, receive grades, etc.**  You'll learn how this works as the semester procedes. 
- **Free and open-source:** All resources and software required for this course.
- "_**Taking a step back, one of the goals of this course is to make you aware of the incredible array of instruction material that is freely available online.** I also want to encourage you to be entrepreneurial. In that spirit, many of the lectures will follow a tutorial on someone’s blog tutorial, or involve reproducing an existing study with open source tools._" -Grant McDermott
- **Group work:**  I'll describe this when the time comes.

 Student Senate Statement on Academic Integrity
</b></p>

We, the Lehigh University Student Senate, as the standing representative body of all undergraduates, reaffirm the duty and obligation of students to meet and uphold the highest principles and values of personal, moral and ethical conduct. As partners in our educational community, both students and faculty share the responsibility for promoting and helping to ensure an environment of academic integrity. As such, each student is expected to complete all academic course work in accordance to the standards set forth by the faculty and in compliance with the University's Code of Conduct.

 More on Academic Integrity 
</b></p>

The work you do in this course must be your own. **This means that you must be aware when you are building on someone else's ideas—including  the ideas of your classmates, your professor, and the authors you read—and explicitly acknowledge when you are doing so.** Feel free to build on, react to, criticize, and analyze the ideas of others but, when you do, make it known whose ideas you are working with. If you ever have questions about drawing the line between others' work and your own, ask me and I will give you clear guidance or you may visit Lehigh Library’s ‘Proper Use of Information’ page at http://libraryguides.lehigh.edu/plagiarism

 The Principles of Our Equitable Community 
</b></p>

The Principles of Our Equitable Community:  Lehigh University endorses [The Principles of Our Equitable Community](www.lehigh.edu/diversity). We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.

 Accommodations for Students with Disabilities 
</b></p>

Lehigh University is committed to maintaining an equitable and inclusive community and welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs.  In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact Disability Support Services (DSS), provide documentation, and participate in an interactive review process.  If the documentation supports a request for reasonable accommodations, DSS will provide students with a Letter of Accommodations. Students who are approved for accommodations at Lehigh should share this letter and discuss their accommodations and learning needs with instructors as early in the semester as possible.  For more information or to request services, please contact Disability Support Services in person in Williams Hall, Suite 301, via phone at 610-758-4152, via email at [indss@lehigh.edu](mailto:indss@lehigh.edu), or online at [https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/disabilities]().
