To update the website with changes, just push a change to the master branch. I usually just add or delete an extraneous space to the README.md file, and push that. 

The **subfolders** correspond to website's "verticals" (things in the topnav menu).

The **topnav** is set, both in terms of style and what the vertical text/links are, in the _layouts/default.html file.
