Half of your participation grade is classroom responses, and half is this participation assessment. This page is about the latter. The intent of the participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities, which are usually live coding sessions. You’ll be putting all your in-class work in your own participation repository hosted on your GitHub user account, which we will evaluate at the end of the course.

## Evaluation

**In short, we’re evaluating completeness, not correctness.** You’ll be prompted in class when you should be contributing to your participation repository, and a full list of items will be posted below here. (The list will evolve as the semester progresses.)

### Completeness (70%)

Your repository should be complete with all in-class exercises. Your work should resemble an honest attempt at the activities, but does not need to be anywhere near “correct” – even completely failing at an activity will earn you full marks here!

Each class session will receive equal weight.

### Documentation (30%)

Your repository should be well-documented and structured. 

- 10%: Does your main README orient a stranger to your repository?
- 10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your repository are for, and where they are located?
- 10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? Although we aren’t expecting publication-quality prose, there should be a moderate level of readability of your scripts to earn you full points here.

### Missing Class

If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time. Again, the point of this is "just to do the work."

## Setup

1. On your user account, make a new repository:

    - Click the "+" in the top-right corner -> "New repository"
    - Call it `FIN377-participation`
    - I highly recommend making this a public repo. But if you so desire, make it private. You can change this later.
    - Say YES to initializing with a README.

2. Add the teaching team as collaborators:

    - Click on “Settings” -> “Collaborators”.
    - Add the instructors: `donbowen` and **%todo Dan's username is needed!**

3. Submit your repo URL to us: **%todo instructions**

    - Don’t worry, we won’t grade it until it’s finished.

## Your repo should include:

1. Live coding worksheet from "Jupyter Basics" lecture. Call this `02 jupyter basics`.
2. More to come... 

## Acknowledgments 

The approach here was initially borrowed wholesale from the wonderful [STAT545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) class. I'm sure it will change over time.
